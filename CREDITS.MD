## What is this?
This is a list of proper CREDITS for this PROJECT and THIRD-PARTY LIBARIES/CODE and other people who I thought DESERVE credit including WHAT they have CONTRIBUTED TO this project.

## Why am I not on this list?
This is mainly for third-party libaries/code and I will not list every person who contributed here as it would take time.
